        <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 3, 2026</p>

        <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>FitSchedule ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
                explains how we handle your information when you use the FitSchedule mobile application.</p>

            <h3>1. Information Collection and Storage</h3>
            <p>FitSchedule operates on a <strong>local-first, privacy-focused</strong> principle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All data stays on your device:</strong> All information you enter into FitSchedule
                    (including member names, contact information, session data, events, and schedules) is stored locally
                    on your device only.</li>
                <li><strong>No cloud storage:</strong> We do not upload, sync, or store any of your data on external
                    servers or cloud services.</li>
                <li><strong>No account required:</strong> FitSchedule does not require registration, login, or account
                    creation.</li>
                <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> We do not track your usage, collect analytics, or monitor your
                    behavior within the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Contact Access</h3>
            <p>FitSchedule requests access to your device contacts to allow you to import member information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact access is <strong>optional</strong> and only used when you choose to import contacts.</li>
                <li>Contact data is only read when you explicitly select contacts to import.</li>
                <li>Imported contact information is stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li>We never upload or share your contacts with any third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. WhatsApp Integration</h3>
            <p>The App includes a feature to open WhatsApp conversations with your members:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This feature simply opens the WhatsApp app on your device with a pre-filled phone number.</li>
                <li>We do not access WhatsApp messages or data.</li>
                <li>We do not track or record WhatsApp usage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your data security depends on your device's security (passcode, biometric lock, etc.).</li>
                <li>We recommend keeping your device secure and backed up.</li>
                <li>If you delete the app, all data stored within it will be permanently deleted.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>FitSchedule does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Age Restrictions</h3>
            <p>FitSchedule is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect or store any personal information
                on external servers, there are no age-related privacy concerns associated with using this app.</p>

            <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the App and on this
                page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>
